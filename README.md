# Artificial Intelligence Trust Enablement

This repository contains a deployable AI hallucination-recognition and confidence-collapse certificate service.

The production-oriented package is in `ai_trust_enablement/`. It provides:

- deterministic AI answer evaluation from context, prompt, and answer,
- concrete state signatures with `phase_value`, `scale_value`, and `seam_memory_value`,
- open-residue classification into `RECOGNITION`, `BOUNDED_RESIDUE`, or `ACTIONABLE_RESIDUE`,
- machine-readable certificates and JSON schema,
- HTTP API service with health/version/schema/evaluate/batch endpoints,
- answer release, repair, retrieval-resolution, and ECL-style finality commit support,
- Docker and docker-compose deployment files,
- no-dependency regression tests.

## Quick start

```bash
python ai_trust_enablement/run_enablement_tests.py
python ai_trust_enablement/server.py
```

In another terminal:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/evaluate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data @examples/evaluate_request.json
```

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t ai-trust-enable:latest .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ai-trust-enable:latest
```

Set `AI_TRUST_API_TOKEN` before exposing the service beyond localhost. The internet remains a swamp with JSON support.

## ECL finality bridge

The AI Trust stack can now seal recognition, repair, release, or retrieval-resolution certificates into an append-only ECL-style finality ledger.

```python
from dataclasses import asdict
from ai_trust_enablement.ai_hallucination_recognition_engine import AIHallucinationRecognitionEngine
from ai_trust_enablement.ecl_commit_adapter import ECLCommitAdapter

engine = AIHallucinationRecognitionEngine()
certificate = asdict(engine.evaluate(
    reference_text="The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris. It was completed in 1889.",
    prompt="Answer using only the supplied context.",
    answer="The Eiffel Tower is located in Berlin. It was completed in 1789.",
))

commit = ECLCommitAdapter().commit_certificate(certificate)
print(commit.to_dict())
```

This creates a chained finality record with certificate hash, proposal hash, positive entropy delta, previous commit pointer, and commit hash. See `docs/ECL_FINALITY_INTEGRATION.md`.

## Documentation

## Status

Deployable v1 for evaluation, gating, audit certificates, regression testing, and integration into AI applications. It is not a standalone truth oracle and not a substitute for domain validation.
